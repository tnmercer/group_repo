A repository for group project 1


Idea: 
A fund manager is interested in building a Happiness Investment Porfolio made up of index funds, weighted by their overall rank in the World Happiness Report. 

This analysis will use the World Happiness Report and Yahoo Finance? for country based index fund data.

Use a global index as a benchmark to compare against the new portfolio. 

The application will use historic data to look for trends in the happiness index?

How often is the report updated?
